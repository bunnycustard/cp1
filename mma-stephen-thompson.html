          Stephen "Wonderboy" Thompson: The Striking Mastermind
        </h1>
        <p>
          The many disciplines in MMA can be organized into striking, grappling, and a mix of the two. Many fighters in today’s MMA are most likely to display a mix of grappling and striking, shaping MMA as its own martial art. Stephen Thompson, on the other hand, is one of the most sophisticated practitioners of the striking aspect of MMA. Born into a family of martial artists, Thompson began learning Kenpo Karate since the age of three from his father. After setting an impressive kickboxing record of 57-0, Thompson transitioned to MMA.<br><br>
          A signature weapon of Thompson’s inside the cage would be his lead leg. Thanks to his karate background, he is able to use his lead leg as a versatile tool. Almost like a jab, he throws kicks from various angles to manage distance, defend, and parry opponents’ attacks. The effect of his use of the front leg is amplified as he freely changes stances between orthodox and southpaw and uses unpredictable steps to set up devastating kicks (wheelkick, roundhouse kick, hook kick etc.) from the rear leg.<br><br>
          However, his punching is not to be discredited. Thompson is arguably one of the best out-boxers and counterpunchers in MMA. His aforementioned stance switching and steps make it difficult for opponents to close the distance and stay in a prolonged striking exchange with Thompson. His punches are often thrown from hard-to-defend angles and at unexpected times to catch the opponent off-guard. When these advantages are combined with his kicking skills, Thompson is almost unstoppable on the feet. He has defeated some of the most revered strikers in the sport, such as Robert Whittaker, Jorge Masvidal, and Rory McDonald.<br><br>
          At this point you might be thinking that his grappling must be abysmal. However, that is not the case. During his career, Thompson has built a great relationship with Chris Weidman (now his brother-in-law) who is one of the best wrestlers in MMA. Training with Weidman has drastically improved Thompson’s takedown defense, a must-have trait for all strikers in MMA. This means that his opponents who shoot for a takedown might be in for a difficult time. However, with Thompson being one of the lighter welterweights, he struggles to escape once he ends up on the ground.<br><br>
          Another disadvantage of Thompson is his extremely low guard. Due to his unorthodox karate-style stance, Thompson’s fists are often down near his waist or thighs. This makes him vulnerable to quick and overarching strikes.
