            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-1">
            Have you ever looked at an NFL player’s stat sheet and thought “this is so bland” or been completely lost whilst watching a UFC fight? Playermade’s goal is to make also to concerns a thing of the past. What we want to do is allow sports fans to view an athlete’s performance in their respective sport as a sort of craft. We will analyze what makes an athlete successful and deliver it to you in easy-to-understand articles. For anyone who is looking to jump into another sport as a fan or to deepen his/her understanding of the sport that they have loved for so long, look no further than Playermade!

            Sports is a surprisingly subjective field for its history and popularity. One person’s view and preference of “good boxing” can be wildly different from the next. Thus, we will not be grading or scaling any athlete’s performance on any sort of numerical range. All we will do is provide you with a direct observation of the athlete’s game. This means that we will say “Pedro Munhoz has one of the most dangerous guillotine chokes in all of MMA” but not “Pedro Munhoz’ grappling is 7.6/10.” It is nearly impossible to predict what will happen in sports but not grading players on numbers will definitely add more flexibility to decoding the outcome of games/matches.

            Does that mean we will throw stats out of the window? Absolutely not! As the age old saying goes, “numbers speak for themselves.” We are simply adding a perspective to analyzing athletic performance: the eye test. Whenever I try to research an NFL player’s performance, I find myself in a pool of numbers and highlight tapes. The truth is that those do not tell the full story. How those numbers were achieved or how that player found themselves in that highlight play is often an overlooked part of the sports world. By analyzing what we see from the “eye test,” we will point out what makes each athlete unique and different from the opponents that he/she is facing.

              As we mentioned earlier, sports can be rather subjective. This makes our analysis just as important as anyone else’s, but not perfect. That is where your input, as the audience, comes in. Anything that you think is important in sports, might be just as important for us too. So, without hesitation, please let us know anything you’d suggest for us, whether it be an athlete you want us to analyze, an aspect of a sport we might be overlooking, or something that we could implement in our website. Sports fans’ input is what’s most important for us and our website and we hope that we can meet every sports fans’ need with this project.
