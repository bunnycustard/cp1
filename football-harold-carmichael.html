          Harold Carmichael: The Gentle Giant of Philly
        </h1>
        <p>
          Many have wondered, "How good would LeBron James be as a football player?" Some say that you don't have to look much further than the 6'8", 230lbs towering receiver who dominated the 70's NFL. Harold Carmichael, who entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a part of the class of 2020, was one of the most unique players in the history of football.<br><br>
          Considering that most cornerbacks are around 5'11"-6'0", Carmichael's 8 inch advantage was an utter mismatch for all defenses he stood up against. Near the red zone, Carmichael was a borderline unstoppable threat with his vertical dominance. In comparison, imagine a NBA power forward going up against a point guard inside the paint. Nine times out of ten, the power forward will score. This was the matchup that Carmichael created on the outside against defenders. As a result, many of Carmichael's signature touchdowns came in the corner of the end zone. His catching skills were also one of his many merits. Many highlights have shown Carmichael making catches that seem out of reach with one hand.<br><br>
          At this point, one might think that Carmichael was simply a jumpball receiver. However, many who have competed with or against him have said that his speed and agility are not to be overlooked. He supposedly had speed that would clock him in at around 4.5 seconds in a 40 yard dash. Furthermore, he was also a sizeable (literally and figuratively) threat after the catch due to his 230lbs frame and quick change of direction. Due to his unusual combination of skills, Carmichael gave rise to the bubble screen, a very common football concept, even today. His gazelle-like strides allowed him to cover a huge chunk of the field in just a few steps. <br><br>
          In terms of weaknesses, Carmichael was not the most precise route runner, partly to due his presence on the field. Many of his routes came in the form of straight lines or catch and run. Secondly, Carmichael has shown some ball security issues, sometimes dropping easy passes.
